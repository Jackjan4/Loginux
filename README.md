# Loginux
Loginux is an open driver software for logitech devices.
I created it because the official Logitech software "Logitech Gaming Software", which is the driver for most Logitech devices, has no support for Linux.

# Motivation
Logitech has no support for Linux and because I own several Logitech devices (which have only limited functionality because the driver delivers most of the functionality), I wanted to find a solution to bring them working.
I invite everyone to help contributing to support more Logitech devices.

# Supported devices
- Logitech G910 (LED-RGB settings)

# Planned supported devices
- Logitech MX518
- Logitech G810
- Logitech G610
- Logitech G510

# Existing features
- Configuring LED-Keys on Orion keyboards

# Planned features
- G-Keys
- Key Heatmap
- SDK for user-created modules
- LED animations


# Installation
It works out of the box. Just download it :)

For using the small Loginux installation you need Java preinstalled. I recommend using the Oracle-JDK, however OpenJDK (with OpenJFX installed) should also be fine.
