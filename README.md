# Loginux
Loginux (a.k.a. Logitech Software for Linux (short "LSL")) is an open driver software for logitech devices.
I created it because the official Logitech software "Logitech Gamimg Software", which is the driver for most Logitech devices, has no support for Linux.

# Motivation
Logitech has no support for Linux and because I own several Logitech devices, which have only limited functionality because the driver delivers most of the functionality, I wanted to find a solution to bring them working.
I invite everyone to help contributing to support more Logitech devices.

# Supported devices
- Logitech G910 (0%)
- Logitech G933 (0%)

# Planned supported devices
- Logitech MX518
- Logitech G930


# Installation

For using Loginux you need Java. I recommend using the Oracle-JDK, however OpenJDK (with OpenJFX installed) should also be fine.
