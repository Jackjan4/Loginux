Loginux (a.k.a. Logitech Software for Linux (short"LSL")) is an open driver software for logitech devices.
I created it because the official Logitech software "Logitech Gamimg Software", which is the driver for most Logitech devices, has no support for Linux.

# Supported devices
- Logitech G910 (0%)
- Logitech G933 (0%)

# Planned supported devices
